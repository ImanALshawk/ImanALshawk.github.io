          For the past 9 years, the police killed three people on average every day.
          These figures have been steady throughout the past decade and are not showing any sign of decline.
          Particularly striking is May 2020, which, amid the protests against police brutality, had the highest number of police shootings in the past 9 years.

            We decided to continue exploring our dataset to see the breakdown of all fatal police shootings that took place between
            2013 and 2017. From this, we constructed a diagram that splits this data up by gender of the victim, and then further
            by race and armed status. Interestingly, we quickly noticed that there was not a huge difference between the number of
            Black males that were fatally shot and the number of White males, even though white males make up a much larger proportion
            of America's population. The difference was even much smaller for the number of Black male victims who ended up
            being unarmed/did not have an actual weapon and the number of White male victims with the same criteria.

            Based on our observations from the sankey diagram, we continued to dig further to fully understand the stats behind
            our initial thoughts. Using data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the World Bank, we compared the percentage of White
            male victims of fatal police shootings to their overall composition makeup in the United States population and repeated
            this process for Black male victims. As expected, we found a roughly 1:1 ratio for White male victims, meaning that the
            proportion of fatal police shooting victims that is White male aligns with the proportion of the United States population
            that is White male. However, this statistic did not hold true for Black males: whereas Black males only make up 6%
            of the United States population, they made up around 24% of all fatal police shooting victims, which is 4x greater.

            Furthermore, we looked into the close numbers between the number of White male victims who ended up
            being unarmed/did not have an actual weapon and the number of Black male victims with the same criteria. We
            found that only 12.5% of all White male victims of fatal police shootings were unarmed, whereas 16.1%
            of Black male victims ended up being unarmed. Unarmed victims don't usually pose a threat, and yet a larger
            proportion of Black males were killed while being unarmed. This causes us to believe that there may be some
            sort of racial bias held by officers when dealing with individuals.

        <p class="long-copy" >
          Young Black Americans are disproportionally killed by police.
          If we set the age range between 13 and 19 years old, we can see that
          the number of Black teenagers killed by police is almost twice that of White teenagers.
          Taking into account that 60% of the American population is White and 15% is Black,
          these figures show that Black teenagers face a significantly higher risk of being targeted by the police.

          We then decided to look at the number of juvenile arrests (arrests of individuals of ages 10-17 years old) that took
          place in the years of 2013 through 2018. From glancing at the stacked bar chart, we can clearly see that the arrest rate
          (which is calculated by dividing the number of reported arrests by the respective population and then multiplying by
          100,000) is significantly higher for Black individuals than White individuals. We observe this same pattern in every single
          one of the years from 2013 through 2018. These results clearly suggest that Black juveniles are targeted more
          often than their White counterparts, implying that racial bias may play a role in a police officerâ€™s decision to arrest an individual.

        We note that some states have significantly higher number of fatal police shootings in comparison to other states.
        For instance, we see that California has the highest number of fatal police shootings in the US,
        with a total number of 1477 shootings. We then decided to look at locations where George Floyd / Black
        Lives Matter protests, actions, or vigils have occurred since May 25, 2020. We represented these events using
        dots, where the size of the radius corresponds to the number of events that took place. We observed that there
        were several events that took place even in states with low numbers of shootings, indicating that people all over
        began to recognize the severity of this issue and protested for justice.
