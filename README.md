### Our final project is divided into two main folders: “resources” and “vendors.” Our “vendors” folder contains all the external libraries we used, including an external js file that helped us create the sankey diagram and a few HTML/CSS files that helped us create our overall website structure (i.e. styled navigation bars, sections, etc.). As for our “resources” folder, it contains “css”, “data”, and “js” folders. As implied from the names, the “css” folder contains all the additional style adjustments that we added to curate the website to our needs, the “data” folder contains all the external data files (such as csv for our data on police shootings and json data that was used for our USA map) that we used to create the visualizations, and finally our “js” file contains main.js as well as all the other js files for each visualization individually. Our JS folder is composed primarily of our own code, with inspiration for a few external functions and lines of codes from other online sources (all are cited in comments within the files).

### Our visualizations are all very straightforward. The only 2 features that may be considered "not obvious" are the drag feature in our sankey diagram and the button click in our last visualization "Remember Their Names."
