### Our final project is divided into two main folders: “resources” and “vendors.” Our “vendors” folder contains all the external libraries we used, including an external js file that helped us create the sankey diagram and a few HTML/CSS files that helped us create our overall website structure (i.e. styled navigation bars, sections, etcz). As for our “resources” folder, it contains “css”, “data”, and “js” folders. As implied from the names, the “css” folder contains all the additional styles’ adjustments that we added to curate the website to our needs, the “data” folder contains all the external data files (such as csv, json, etc.) that we used to create the visualizations, and finally our “js” file contains main.js as well as all the other js files for each visualization individually.
